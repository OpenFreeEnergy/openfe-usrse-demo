# OpenFE Demo: USRSE 2025

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/OpenFreeEnergy/openfe-usrse-demo/blob/main/src/openfe_demo.ipynb)

You can find the demo notebook in `src/openfe_demo.ipynb`, or you can run in your browser by clicking on the "Open in Colab" button above.

See the [openfe git repo](https://github.com/OpenFreeEnergy/openfe) and [documentation](https://docs.openfree.energy/en/latest/) to learn more!

## Installing openfe locally (recommended)

To run the notebook locally (i.e. not in Colab), you'll need to install **openfe**:

Installing from conda-forge is simplest, and you can use `mamba` or `conda`:

```bash

mamba create -n openfe openfe=1.6.1
mambda activate openfe

```

then open the demo with `jupyter notebook src/openfe_demo.ipynb`.
